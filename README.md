# ChatBot

Requirements and starter code for a simple conditionals-based Python chatbot.

Original directions and requirements by Edhesive Intro to CS.

## Instructions

A chatbot is a computer program designed to emulate human conversation. For this program, you will use if statements, user input, and random numbers to create a basic chatbot.

## Criteria/Constraints

You have decided to start a website and are creating a chatbot prototype to show investors so you can raise money and launch your website.

Your chatbot should ask the user the following (minimum requirements for the grader) and then give answers depending on the answers the user inputs:

* at least 5 questions
* at least 2 if-elif-else statements
* the use of the random module and randomly generated numbers 


Based on these criteria, some responses will be based on what the user types and some will be based on random numbers.

For example, if the chatbot asks how the user is doing, your chatbot might respond `I’m sorry to hear that.` in response to a user input of `sad`, or `That's great!` in response to a user input of `happy`.

Additionally, you could also have a random number generated between, say, `1` and `3` and have a corresponding response depending on the number to randomly answer with `That is great to hear.` or `So interesting.`, and so on.

## Sample Run

Please note that due to the infinite possibility of questions that can be asked, your program will be different—this is only one example.

```
What is your first name?
Pascal
What is your last name?
Smith
Hi there, Pascal Smith, nice to meet you!

How old are you?
17
17 is a good age.
You are old enough to drive.

So, Pascal, how are you today?
Happy
You are happy.
That is good to hear.
Tell me more.

I am just happy.
That's good to hear.

Well, Pascal, it has been nice chatting with you.
